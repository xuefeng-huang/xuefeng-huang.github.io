I have been doing programming professionally for 1 year plus now, from C++ to Java(this one not focused on development though) and to Python(web development using Flask). Learned couple of things along the way, but still I am feeling this is not a good way to develop my skills. There are too many languages and frameworks out there, I only touched some surface level stuff. I still feel not confident enough to handle big scale project.  
I am determined to learn Android development and to dig deep into it. I am learning some basics from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Android course, there has to be some challenges coming up, I am exited to see what I can do this time! Cheers
