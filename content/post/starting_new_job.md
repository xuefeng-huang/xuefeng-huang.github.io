I stopped updating this blog for an insanely long time. Admitted, I have got no habit of writing. But that is going to change now, I have read about the good points of writing and decided to make it a habit to write regularly, if not daily, to keep track of what has been happening in my life. I believe it is a good way towards more logical thinking or ranting :)  
  
I will be joining a new company called Monstar Lab, a digital consultancy headquarted in Japan. I am excited to start new phase in my life and keep learning new technology and building stuff. I have been watching a lot historical videos lately and found them quite interesting to know. Some facts completely blow my mind and changed the way I think and reshaped my old values about things. I might write about it in future post.  
  
Till next time, cheers!
