Attended first Android meetup yesterday at NUS Enterprise building, the event was in conjunction with [Google developer group](http://www.gdg-sg.org/)(GDG) event where engineers from Google showed us what developers and startup companies can make use of various Google services to boost their productivity. And also some statistics from the Google Play, how majority of the apps make money there.  
GDG will be organizing an Android study jam later this week, but it focuses on the very basic level this time, I have already worked through those courses online, I might skip it.
Overall, it was good to meet people and get more info about new trend in Android development. Cheers!
