In Java when Runnable object is created it will usually be passed to thread object and run as another thread. But I watched this Android tutorial online and the author dived into the source code of Handler class for Android OS. In its post method it accept a runnable object, to my surprise, it does not use that to spawn a new thread, rather it calls the run method directly to use it as a callback function. Kinda hacky.
