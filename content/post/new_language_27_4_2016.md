I have decided to learn one new programming language for 2016, after some consideration I have settled on **JavaScript** for the following reasons:  
<ol>
    <li>it can be used on both frontend and backend</li>
    <li>it can be used to build mobile APPs</li>
    <li>there are plenty of resources for learning</li>
</ol>
I will try to use it to build something and may be apply it on my daily job. I have some basic knowledge about it, will get more insights this time. Cheers.
