Get my hand dirty with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. My last blog has become so outdated, hugo will make a jumpstart this time. **折腾不止！**
Set up by following the documents on Hugo site. I made two branches on github repo, pushed all code except **public** folder to source branch, hugo will generate all html in **public** folder and I pushed all contents in this folder to master branch. 
I used [Hugo Bootstrap](http://themes.gohugo.io/bootstrap/) theme, more things need to be done such as about page, resume page etc. 
Integrated Disqus comment system. Pretty neat.
