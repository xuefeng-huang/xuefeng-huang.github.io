I have solved one algorithm problem on Codewars last night. The algorithm needs to find out the only odd integer from a group of even ones and vice versa. I solved it using only one pass of the whole list, O(n) complexity. I found one clever way of doing it by another user, it passes the list 3 times, but it is definitely more clear to read. Enjoy the beauty:
